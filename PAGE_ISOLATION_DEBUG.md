# Page Isolation Debug Test

## Current Status

- ✅ Added debugging logs to understand state behavior
- ✅ Using refs to avoid stale closure issues
- ⏳ Testing page switching functionality

## Test Scenario

### Step 1: Generate First Page Flowchart

1. Open the browser at localhost:8083
2. Click "Pages" button (should show blue highlight)
3. Add a page called "Login Page"
4. Click edit button and add prompt:

   ```
   Step 1: Show login form
   Step 2: Validate credentials
   Step 3: Redirect to dashboard
   ```

5. Click "Save & Generate Flow"
6. **Expected**: Cyan-colored flowchart appears on canvas
7. **Debug**: Check console for logs starting with 💾

### Step 2: Generate Second Page Flowchart

1. Add another page called "Dashboard"
2. Click edit button and add prompt:

   ```
   Step 1: Load user data
   Step 2: Display widgets
   Step 3: Show navigation
   ```

3. Click "Save & Generate Flow"
4. **Expected**: New cyan-colored flowchart replaces the first one
5. **Debug**: Check console for logs starting with 💾

### Step 3: Switch Back to First Page

1. Click on "Login Page" row in the Pages Panel
2. **Expected**: Login page flowchart should reappear
3. **Debug**: Check console for logs starting with 🔄

### Step 4: Switch to Second Page Again

1. Click on "Dashboard" row in the Pages Panel
2. **Expected**: Dashboard flowchart should reappear
3. **Debug**: Check console for logs starting with 🔄

## Debug Information to Look For

### Console Logs

- `💾 Storing page content:` - When content is stored
- `💾 New Nodes Count:` - Number of nodes being stored
- `💾 Updated allPageNodes:` - The updated storage object
- `🔄 Page Switch Requested:` - When page switch is initiated
- `📊 All Page Nodes (ref):` - Current ref content
- `🎯 Target Page Nodes:` - The nodes being retrieved for the target page
- `✅ Found content for page, switching...` - Success message
- `❌ No content found for page, clearing canvas...` - Failure message

### Expected Behavior

- Each page should maintain its own isolated flowchart
- Switching between pages should show different content
- Generated flowcharts should persist until browser reload

### Known Issues

- ❌ Generated page flowcharts disappear when switching back to previously generated pages
- ❓ Need to verify if the issue is with storage or retrieval
